# Runtime Modes

Use this file when deciding how the agent should operate over time.

---

# 1. Autonomous Script Mode

Recommended default.

Behavior:
- run your own loop
- poll agent state
- choose actions
- submit actions
- verify outcomes on future polls

Advantages:
- maximum control
- easy to integrate custom team logic
- best fit for tactical agents

# 2. Heartbeat Mode

Heartbeat mode may be available as a managed runtime pattern.

Use it when:
- you want continuous activity from start to end
- you are relying on a platform-defined runtime pattern

Read the dedicated heartbeat documentation when using that mode.

# 3. Cost Guidance

Agents act repeatedly over time.
Expensive reasoning stacks can create unnecessary cost.

Prefer:
- scripts
- compact decision rules
- cheaper model configurations where possible

High-cost reasoning should be reserved for genuinely difficult situations.
